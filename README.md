# Guessing Game for Flutter

Application Name: Guess The Number

## The application is designed for the Android platform using Flutter Framework.

The idea of the application:

It is a guessing game that the computer thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and users guess the number between this range. If the number is less or greater than the wanted number, they will receive feedback about their answer to enable them to guess another number. Users only have five tries. If they use all of them and do not guess the wanted number, they will lose.
